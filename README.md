# Pyroclastic Go!

[Play the game](https://nschrading.itch.io/pyroclastic-go) on itch.io!

Recover lost knowledge as you escape the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Get jumping!

Ancient Greek scrolls billow from the heavens as they are tossed from the library at Herculaneum. Read them to improve your jumps and temporarily reduce gravity.

Don't worry if you die. Retry and your past thymoeides will aid you on your way. Reach half their height and press 'F' to free them, gaining the ability to shrink and navigate out of tough spaces.
